# Project Proposal 

**Project Title** : Virtual Air Thunder Fighter (game)

**Team Members**: Xinlei Chen & Hanwen Yang

### Description:
We are planning to develop a game bases on our Arduino components called the Virtual Air Thunder
Fighter. It is a game that requires only one people to play but two members to complete. The game is 
quite simple and requires only a LCD display, a joystick and several wires. At the beginning, there will
be a plane at the middle bottom of the LCD display, and player can control the plane using the joystick(i.e, when the player moving the joystick upward, the plane will go up; when the joystick moves downward, the plane moves down; when the joystick moves left, the plane moves left; when
the joystick moves right, the plane moves right). Besides, there will be barriers(we call them bullets)
appear randomly from the top of the LCD. Players can either control the plane to avoid those bullets 
which are harmful to the plane in order to survive from the chaos, or aim at those bullets and shoot 
them. When a bullet gets shot, it will disappear from the screen. Finally, as long as the plane doesnâ€™t
hit by those bullets, the game will keep going. However, when the plane is hit, the game is over, the score(bullets shot) displays on the LCD, players push the joystick, the game restarts.
(The way of wiring is the same as assignment 2).

### Milestones 


* **Nov. 16:** 
Finish shaping the plane and the controller(Which is the joystick), and the plane moves as the joystick moves. When the plane hits a point, game over and player needs to push the joystick to restart the 
game.

* **Nov. 23:**
The program is able to generate random bullets, and bullets will keep moving down toward the plane.
Players can control the plane and avoid those bullets, but still cannot shoot, and when the plane hits 
one of them, game over, restarts.

* **Nov. 30:**
Plane is already able to shoot, and when a bullet gets shot, it disappears from the LCD, and the 
program is able to calculate how many bullets does player shot, which ends up to be the score after a
round. The score will automatically displays when the game is over.

* **Dec 2:**
README completed, includes wiring instructions, functionality and How To Play information, check any bugs which are possibly pop up.
